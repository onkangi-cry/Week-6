# Week-6
AI Smart Systems: Edge AI, Quantum Computing & Ethical AI Applications
This project is a complete portfolio demonstrating practical and theoretical skills in Edge AI, Quantum Computing, IoT, and AI Ethics. It includes real-time applications, predictive modeling, fairness assessments, and futuristic AI concepts aligned with 2030 goals.

Project is structured into 3 parts with code, explanation, diagrams, and proposals.

Part 1: Theoretical Analysis
Edge AI vs Cloud AI:

Explained how Edge AI reduces latency and enhances data privacy with real-world examples like autonomous drones.

Quantum AI vs Classical AI:

Compared both approaches in solving optimization problems and identified industries like logistics, finance, and drug discovery that benefit from Quantum AI.

Human-AI Collaboration in Healthcare:

Discussed how AI enhances roles of nurses and radiologists through diagnostics, alerts, and workload management.

Case Study - AI in Smart Cities:

Analyzed how AI combined with IoT improves traffic flow and predictive infrastructure maintenance, while also highlighting security and interoperability challenges.

Part 2: Practical Implementation
Task 1: Edge AI Prototype

Built a lightweight image classification model in TensorFlow and converted it to TensorFlow Lite.

Tested it for real-time predictions to demonstrate Edge AI benefits like low latency and privacy.

Task 2: AI-Driven IoT in Smart Agriculture

Proposed sensors like soil moisture, pH, and light intensity.

Designed a data flow diagram and suggested a Random Forest model for crop yield prediction.

Task 3: AI Ethics in Personalized Medicine

Explored biases in cancer treatment datasets.

Suggested mitigation strategies using IBM AI Fairness 360 and subgroup evaluation techniques.

Part 3: Futuristic Proposal (2030)
"ClimateGuard" â€“ an AI system to manage global carbon removal projects using reinforcement learning and satellite + IoT data. It solves coordination, impact tracking, and real-time optimization for climate solutions.
